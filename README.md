# PROJECT---AgriTech
AI &amp; LoRa-Based Microclimate Advisory for Smart Farming is a frontend prototype of a smart agriculture dashboard. It allows farmers to upload crop images for disease analysis, view simulated microclimate sensor data, and receive advisory suggestions through an interactive and user-friendly interface.

# AI & LoRa-Based Microclimate Advisory for Smart Farming 🌱

Frontend prototype of a smart farming web dashboard that combines AI disease prediction concepts and simulated LoRa microclimate monitoring into an interactive interface.
This version focuses on UI/UX design and dashboard visualization for agricultural advisory systems.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents a web interface designed for farmers to:

- Upload crop leaf images for disease analysis
- View simulated microclimate sensor readings
- Receive crop advisory suggestions
- Monitor environmental trends through charts

The system is designed as a frontend prototype demonstrating how AI-driven smart farming platforms can function in real-world scenarios.

Current Version: *Frontend prototype (backend integration in progress)*
